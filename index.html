To use this bookmarklet, simply drag one of the following to your bookmark bar:

<li>HEAD (Always latest version: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){var s = document.createElement('script');s.src = 'https://gist.github.com/raw/4331769/bookmarklet.js';document.body.appendChild(s);})();">RuleOfThirds</a>

<li>December 18, 2012 release: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){var s = document.createElement('script');s.src = 'https://gist.github.com/raw/4331769/0ef0fa78ca1038d1f4e1a36e76ade40afced2171/bookmarklet.js';document.body.appendChild(s);})();">RuleOfThirds</a>

The former will be kept up to date (new features, etc) while using the snapshot version is more stable (it won't stop working if I push a bad commit) and more secure (say if my github account gets compromised and malicious JS is pushed, it will not be injected into websites by bookmarklet on). 
(You'll always know what JS code you're injecting onto a given page).
