<p>To use this bookmarklet, simply drag one of the following to your bookmark bar:</p>

<ul>
<li>HEAD version of rule_of_thirds.bookmarklet.js:
<a href="javascript:(function(){var s = document.createElement('script');s.src = 'https://gist.github.com/raw/4331769/bookmarklet.js';document.body.appendChild(s);})();">RuleOfThirds</a>

<li>December 18, 2012 release of rule_of_thirds.bookmarklet.js: 
<a href="javascript:(function(){var s = document.createElement('script');s.src = 'https://gist.github.com/raw/4331769/0ef0fa78ca1038d1f4e1a36e76ade40afced2171/bookmarklet.js';document.body.appendChild(s);})();">RuleOfThirds</a>
</ul>

<p>The former will be kept up to date (new features, etc) while using the snapshot version is more stable (it won't stop working if I push a bad commit) and more secure (say if my github account gets compromised and malicious JS is pushed, it will not be injected into websites by bookmarklet on).
